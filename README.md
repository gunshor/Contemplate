Contemplate
===========

Sensible Photoshop templates, so you don't have to think about it. This project is a work in progress (and most likely always will be). The documentation especially so.

Web
---

The "wow" file is in web/webpage.psd.

Favicon
-------

I suggest [Telegraphics's free plugins](http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/) for favicon.ico creation. Specifically, use the "Ico (Windows icon) format" plugin to create individual .ico files, then highlight and drag all of them on top of the "Icobundle Utility," which will create a single .ico file of various resolutions.

Facebook
--------

The maximum size of the Facebook Page image is 200x600.

The [Open Graph image](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph) minimum size is 50x50 and has a maximum aspect ratio of 3:1. That means the widest image is 150 pixels if the minimum height is respected at 50 pixels, and the tallest image is 150 pixels if the minimum width is respected at 50 pixels. I couldn't find information on the image's maximum size, but I suspect Facebook doesn't want to encourage images to be prematurely sized for a website that is constantly in flux, but rather provide general guidelines and let Facebook create optimized images as needs change.
